#Asp.net Core Web Api - Email Dispatch Service
-------------------------------------------------

✅ I’ve developed a Web API for the backend service of my personal website. This API, built with ASP.NET Core, handles email transmissions. It works by processing messages that clients submit through a form on the website. Once the form is filled out and submitted, the API takes care of sending the email.

✅ In the process of programming the API, I adhered to clean code requirements and SOLID principles. Key principles such as dependency injection have been fully implemented and are functioning as expected.

-------------------------------------------------

‼️Important Notice :
🔹To use and customize this API, please follow these steps :

🔸The API operates by using two personal emails
     one for sending and another for receiving.

🔸Navigate to AppSettings.Json in the project and ensure that you’ve filled out the necessary details for both the sender and receiver email accounts. Use your own two emails for this purpose.

🔸The email account used for sending should have ‘AppPassword’ enabled. This can be easily done in the security settings of your Google account if you’re using Gmail. Use this ‘AppPassword’ as the password for the sender email.
