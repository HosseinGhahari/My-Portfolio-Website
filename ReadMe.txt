       and my work , this web site based on html css that uses 
       tailwind css for styling and pure js for some operations.

✅ The site features a contact form powered by an ASP.NET 
      Core Web API, ensuring seamless communication. Feel 
      free to explore the API's code, which is readily 
      available on my GitHub.
